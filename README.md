# PedalPi
Pedal Pi Thawney is based off of Pedal-Pi by electrosmash; a lo-fi programmable guitar pedal that works with the Raspberry Pi ZERO Board. 

The difference is that my version also has open source PCB files, Case Schematic files, and anything else needed to make the project work (as well as example code of various pugins), unlike electrosmash who claims to be open source but will not share or does not produce certain files (such as Gerbers and Protective case designs)
