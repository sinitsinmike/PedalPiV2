# Info On The Cases.

Currently There aren't any designs for cases as I haven't finished building my PCB and I am yet to get my hands on a Raspberry Pi Zero. Because of this I need to make a model of the project to get accurate measurements for cases. (Alternatively if someone wants to make a cad model of the PedalPi that would be amazing)
